High Pass Filter design in simulink.
The filter is designed using Direct Form II.

Specifications:
Pass Band Frequency: 1000 Hz
PAss Band Attenuation: 3 dB
Stop Band Attenuation: 10 dB (at 350 Hz)

Frequencies used in the model:
100 Hz
500 Hz
1000 Hz
1500 Hz
2000 Hz

As we increase the frequency, the sine wave in the scope gets distorted. We can still see the operation of the filter as the magnitude of the output is increasing as the frequency increases.
